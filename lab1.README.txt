The code will create a 2D geometric figure, a compound figure of four triangles with red, green and blue in each vertex.
My lab2.js file has three functions namely to draw the colored triangles, and to move the object, to switch between the 'S'(-Down), 'W'(-Up), 'A'(-left),'D'(-Right) and '1'(-Original Position),and the render function.
